# CRYPTOS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a mini cryptocurrency platform which provides some informations about available coins. 
The project includes these features:

- A List of available coins with general informations
- Filtering coins by some convertible currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, XAF, JPY, CNY )
- Search function for a specific coin
- A coin page with details

The app is using [Nomics API](https://nomics.com/docs/) as API.
